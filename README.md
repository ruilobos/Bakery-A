# Bakery

## Objective
Bakey is a web application that was part of my MSc capstone project in Applied Software Development. This web application was the prototype to validate the technologies and development methodologies discussed in the capstone project. It was developed based on user requirements, which were identified and analyzed in the early stages of the project.
Bakery's objective is to provide tools for users to manage their Bakery's raw materials, suppliers and products.

## Description
The user can use the Bakery to analyze how much he is paying for raw materials, compare the values between several suppliers, can analyze the costs of each product as well as the margins related to raw material costs.
Bakery provides a Dashboard with key information for each product, allowing the user to assess changes in real time. The web application design is responsive and can be used on both mobiles, tablets and PCs.

It is possible to register multiple users and define access criteria according to needs. If it is necessary to use the data in legacy systems, it is possible to export the data in CSV format.
Database Design was one of the biggest challenges of the project. Developing all the tables, defining the relationships between them and allowing their expansion was essential for the Bakery to be able to meet the needs of users.

## Features
-	User Access Control;
-	Export Database to CSV file;
-	Dashboard with key information;
-	Control of Suppliers;
-	Management of Raw Materials and Products;
-	Calculation of Costs and Relative Margins;
-	Responsive design adapting to PC, Tablet or Mobile screens.

Technical Features:
-	Responsive design developed with Bootstrap & HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
-	Server side developed in Python, using Django Framework;
-	For the database, PostgreSQL was used;
-	The Web App uses the Heroku platform for Deployment.

## How to Use
To use Bakery Web App just access https://bakery-a.herokuapp.com/and login with: user: Visitor, password: @example.

## Credits
This web application was entirely developed by me, using my knowledge acquired along my journey as a software developer.

## Project Status
This web application is still in the prototyping phase and several features need to be improved or developed. The next steps will be: Develop functionality to compare the prices of raw materials from different suppliers; develop the research tool; improve user management by allowing new users to register directly in the application.
